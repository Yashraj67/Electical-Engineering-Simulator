# Electical Engineering Simulator 

An Electrical Engineering application using C++ with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts designed to calculate values for both AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current) circuits. Leveraging OOP principles
allows for a modular and organized approach to modeling electrical components and circuits.

- **Technologies used :** C++ , Object Oriented Programming
